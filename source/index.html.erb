          Code together on anything at Cowork Niagara on the fourth monday of
          the month.

        <p>
          We organize a meetup once a month to get a group of people together
          to hack on anything. It doesn't mmatter what language, framework or
          license you want to use. Everyone is welcome. Hack alone or in a group.
          Work on the next big thing or contribute to an open source project.
        </p>

        <p>
          We kick off each session with a call to arms. Tell us who you are and
          what you want to work. Don't be afraid to ask for help or to offer
          help. It is an open and collaborative environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          No need to eat before hand. We provide free pizza.
