# Software Niagara

This is the official repository for the Software Niagara website. It includes
information on Software Niagara, which is a grassroots initiative to connect
the software community in the Niagara Region. Over time, we hope to include
software-related news and articles.

## Getting Start

SoftwareNiagara.com is built with Middleman - a static site generator written in
Ruby. Using Middleman allows us to store all of the source and content for the
website in GitHub. It also allows us to accept contributions from the community
via pull requests.

You will need Ruby 2.x and Bundler installed in order to build and run the
website on your local machine.

Install dependencies:
`bundle install`

Start the preview server:
`bundle exec rake server`

Visit the website on your machine at `http://localhost:4567`.
