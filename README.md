This is the repository for the Software Niagara marketing website. It includes
information on Software Niagara, which is a grassroots initiative to connect
the software community in the Niagara Region. Over time, we hope to include
software-related news and articles.

## Getting Started

The Software Niagara marketing website is built with Middleman - a static site
generator written in Ruby. Using Middleman allows us to store all of the
source code and content for the website in GitHub. It also allows us to
accept contributions from the community via pull requests.

You will need Ruby 2.3 and Bundler installed on your system to run this website.

Run these commands from the project directory to install dependencies, run
the development server, and visit the website in your default browser.

```
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
bundle exec middleman server
open http://localhost:4567
```
