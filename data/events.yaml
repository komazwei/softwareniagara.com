        Great things are being built right here in Niagara and we want to shine a
        spotlight on those products and the teams behind them.
      </p>

        From time-to-time we host DemoCamp Niagara to provide five local entrepreneurs
        with the opportunity to show-off the tech products they've built. Each product
        gets a 5-minute demo followed by a 5-minute question and answer period. We
        even throw in free snacks and an inspirational keynote.
